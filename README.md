# MathInPython

 This Project contain programming way of learning math, The reason why we write is because we can remeber and have visual memory . The same thing and much beetter analysis and understanding can be done with good visualization like pyplot of matlab.
 
 Every mathematical oerator we discuss and learn its different form of application we will analyse it by pltting graph of the same function on different data set to uderstand the growth and pattern.
 
 This can be a great tutorial and tool to teach kids mathematics and in a more fun and approachable way.
 
 
 The project also experiements and visualizes various physics laws.
